# toMarkdown Viewer (desktop GUI)

Desktop viewer for Markdown, vaults, and every format the converters support (PDF, DOCX, HTML, EPUB, …) — a Tauri app in `gui/`, sharing all conversion/vault logic with the MCP server through the `to_markdown_mcp` library crate.

## Status

Phase 5 of the [roadmap](../planning/ROADMAP.md): foundation & viewer. Later phases add live file watching, Obsidian-grade vault navigation (backlinks, graph, search), Typora-style editing, and AI features.

## Current features

- **File tree sidebar** — open a folder (native picker, drag-and-drop, or recents); directories collapse/expand; hidden and build directories are filtered out; the tree refreshes automatically when files are added or removed
- **Rendered Markdown pane** — headings, tables, task lists, footnotes, strikethrough (pulldown-cmark); code and config files render as fenced code blocks with detected language
- **Any supported format** — non-Markdown files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, EPUB, HTML, …) are converted to Markdown by the shared pipeline before rendering
- **Live preview** — the open file is watched (`notify`); edit it in any external editor and the pane re-renders on save, preserving your scroll position (Marked 2 style)
- **Table of contents** — clickable, indentation-per-level, generated from the rendered headings
- **Themes** — System / Light / Dark / Sepia, plus a user CSS file that layers on top (persisted and reloaded on start)
- **Export** — standalone styled HTML (theme + user CSS inlined), Print / save-as-PDF via the system dialog, and copy-as-rich-text to paste into email/docs
- **Stats footer** — word count, character count, estimated read time
- **Recent files & folders** — persisted locally, one click to reopen
- **Wikilink navigation** — `[[target#heading|alias]]` links are clickable and resolve with Obsidian's shortest-path rules; embeds appear as ⧉ links; `.canvas` boards render as structured Markdown
- **Note panel** — frontmatter properties, tags (click to search), and backlinks with source context for the open note
- **Vault search tab** — full text, tag (nested-prefix aware), alias, or frontmatter field
- **Tags & Tasks tabs** — vault-wide tag browser sorted by count; all checkbox tasks with state, due date, and source
- **Graph view** — force-directed link graph (global or current-note local), drag nodes, click to open
- **Quick switcher** — Cmd/Ctrl+O (or P) fuzzy-opens notes by title or alias
- **Editing (Cmd+E)** — split source-editor with instant live preview; autosave (atomic writes, debounced), native undo/redo, find & replace, table skeleton insertion
- **Vault-aware authoring** — `[[` wikilink and `#` tag autocomplete at the caret, paste an image to file it in the vault's attachment folder as an `![[embed]]`, click checkboxes in the reading view to toggle tasks in the file
- **Note management** — New Note (folder-in-title supported, templates via vault config), Rename with inbound wikilink rewriting, YAML frontmatter editor with validation
- **Intelligence** — Related-notes in the note panel, a Semantic (vector) search mode using the persistent `.tomarkdown` embedding index, and AI actions (summarize, suggest tags, translate, ask about the document) when an Anthropic API key is set in Settings; results open in an overlay with Copy / Insert-into-note
- **Command palette** — Cmd/Ctrl+K runs any app action by name
- **Settings** — Cmd/Ctrl+, for theme, content font size, and the API key (persisted locally)

## Build & run

The GUI is excluded from default workspace builds (`cargo build` still builds only the MCP server). Build it explicitly:

```bash
cargo build -p to_markdown_gui            # compile
cargo run -p to_markdown_gui              # launch the viewer
```

Packaging a macOS `.app` / installers uses the Tauri CLI: `cargo install tauri-cli`, then `cargo tauri build` from `gui/`. Bundling is enabled with a full icon set (`gui/icons/`, including `.icns`); signing/notarization requires Apple Developer certificates and is not configured.

## Architecture

- `gui/src/main.rs` — Tauri commands: `list_tree` (recursive, sorted, filtered), `open_file` (convert → Markdown → HTML), `pick_folder`/`pick_file` (native dialogs)
- `gui/ui/index.html` — single-file vanilla JS frontend (no npm/bundler); talks to Rust via `window.__TAURI__` (`withGlobalTauri`)
- `src/lib.rs` / `src/pipeline.rs` — the shared library: all converter modules plus `convert_any_to_markdown` with the large-file guardrails
