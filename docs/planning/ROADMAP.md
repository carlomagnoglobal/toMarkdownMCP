# toMarkdownMCP Development Roadmap

Multi-phase roadmap as of July 2026. Each phase is independently shippable: green `cargo test`, docs updated, committed and pushed to main. Publishing/registry submissions are **deferred** and tracked separately in [docs/deployment/](../deployment/).

Current baseline: v0.1.1 on crates.io — 62 MCP tools ([FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md](../mcp_functions/FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md)), TUI viewer, 282 tests passing.

## Phase 0 — Roadmap refresh ✅

- [x] Update [PLANNED_ENHANCEMENTS.md](PLANNED_ENHANCEMENTS.md) to mark shipped items
- [x] Create this roadmap and link it from the README

## Phase 1 — CLI support ✅ (code complete; ships as v0.2.0)

Make the binary usable directly from the terminal, not only as an MCP server.

- [x] Proper CLI via `clap` (derive), preserving existing behavior: no args → MCP server; `tui [PATH]`; `--base-dir`
- [x] `convert <SOURCE> [-o out.md] [--type LANG] [--line-numbers] [--title T]` — file/URL/stdin → Markdown (wraps `convert_from_source` logic)
- [x] `batch <FILES>... [-o out.md]` — combined document for up to 10 files (wraps `batch_convert_files`)
- [x] `search <QUERY> --dir <DIR>` — wraps `search_content`
- [x] `tools [TOOL_NAME]` — tool catalog / per-tool help (reuses `get_tool_help`; detailed help now falls back to the tools/list schema for every tool)
- [x] CLI arg-parsing unit tests + CLI integration tests on the fixture vault
- [x] Docs: USAGE.md, QUICK_START.md, README

## Phase 2 — MCP protocol depth ✅

- [x] `resources/list` + `resources/read`: expose `--base-dir` vault files as MCP resources (`file://` URIs, capped at 1000; reads confined to the base dirs; non-Markdown formats converted on read)
- [x] `prompts/list` + `prompts/get`: `summarize_note`, `ingest_url`, `vault_health` templates
- [x] Declare `resources` and `prompts` capabilities in the `initialize` response
- [x] `MCP_TOOL_SCHEMA.json` unchanged (tool list did not change)

## Phase 3 — Real embeddings RAG ✅

- [x] `Embedder` trait (`src/embeddings.rs`) with a fastembed/ONNX backend (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, behind the opt-in `embeddings` cargo feature) and an always-available hashed-vector fallback
- [x] Persistent per-directory vector index (`.tomarkdown/embeddings_index.json`) with incremental re-index by mtime and model-change invalidation
- [x] Wired into `retrieve_context`, `find_related_notes`, `find_duplicates`, `cluster_documents` behind an opt-in `embeddings: true` parameter (no breaking schema changes; `MCP_TOOL_SCHEMA.json` regenerated)

## Phase 4 — Hardening & quality ✅

- [x] Large-file gate for >10MB files: plain text/code streams through a single pre-sized buffer; structured formats (HTML/docs/markup) are refused with guidance and a `max_bytes` override on `convert_file`; same gate protects the RAG directory scans
- [x] `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean; clippy enforced in CI (rustfmt deliberately not enforced — the pre-existing style diverges and a repo-wide reformat would bury history)
- [x] End-to-end JSON-RPC integration tests per tool family (`tests/jsonrpc.rs`), including resources/prompts and error-shape checks
- [x] Error audit: missing/invalid arguments now return `-32602 Invalid params` naming the parameter; execution failures return `-32603` with the real cause instead of a generic "Internal error"

## Phases 5–9 — GUI application

Desktop GUI with functionality on par with **Obsidian, Typora, MacMD Viewer, and Marked 2**. Tauri app in a new `gui/` crate (repo becomes a Cargo workspace; shared logic extracted to a library crate both binaries link). GUI MVP (Phase 5) ships as v0.3.0.

### Phase 5 — Foundation & viewer (MacMD Viewer parity) ✅ (packaging pending)

- [x] Cargo workspace restructuring: shared `src/lib.rs` + `src/pipeline.rs`; `default-members` keeps plain `cargo build`/`test` on the MCP crate
- [x] Tauri viewer crate (`gui/`, run with `cargo run -p to_markdown_gui`): file-tree sidebar, rendered Markdown pane (pulldown-cmark), OS light/dark theme — see [docs/gui/GUI.md](../gui/GUI.md)
- [x] Open any supported format (PDF/DOCX/HTML/... via the shared conversion pipeline; code files render as fenced blocks with detected language)
- [x] Drag-and-drop (files and folders), native open dialogs, persisted recent files
- [ ] macOS `.app` packaging (`bundle.active` currently false; needs tauri-cli + icon set); Linux/Windows CI builds — deferred to the Phase 9 distribution pass

### Phase 6 — Live preview & watching (Marked 2 parity) ✅

- [x] File and folder watching with debounced re-render (`notify` crate; tree refresh on create/remove, file reload on save)
- [x] Scroll-position preservation across live reloads (ratio-based)
- [x] Clickable TOC sidebar built from the rendered headings (JS-side; simpler than round-tripping through `toc_generator.rs`)
- [x] Export standalone styled HTML (theme + user CSS inlined), Print/save-as-PDF via the system dialog, copy-as-rich-text
- [x] Bundled themes (System/Light/Dark/Sepia) + user CSS file support, persisted
- [x] Stats footer: words/chars/read-time

### Phase 7 — Vault navigation & knowledge (Obsidian parity, read side) ✅

- [x] Wikilinks render as clickable anchors resolved with Obsidian's shortest-path rules (`[[target#heading|alias]]`, embeds shown as ⧉ links; full transclusion rendering still pending)
- [x] Note panel: frontmatter properties, tags (click → tag search), backlinks with context
- [x] Vault-wide search tab: full text / tag / alias / frontmatter field (reuses `obsidian::tools::search`)
- [x] Interactive graph view: canvas force layout, node size by degree, drag, click-to-open, global + current-note local modes
- [x] Tasks tab across the vault (state, due date, source line); `.canvas` files render via the JsonCanvas converter
- [x] Quick switcher (Cmd/Ctrl+O or P): fuzzy match over titles and aliases

### Phase 8 — Editing (Typora / Obsidian parity, write side) ✅ (split-view, not in-place WYSIWYG)

- [x] Live editing as a split source-editor + instant preview (Cmd+E toggles; no npm/bundler constraint ruled out Milkdown/CodeMirror — in-place WYSIWYG remains a possible later upgrade)
- [x] Autosave (debounced + on blur, atomic temp-file rename, vault index invalidation, self-save suppression in the file watcher), native undo/redo, find-and-replace bar
- [x] Table skeleton insertion, click-to-toggle tasks in the reading view, `[[` wikilink and `#` tag autocomplete with caret-positioned dropdown, paste-image into the vault's attachment folder as `![[embed]]`
- [x] New note (respects folder-in-title), rename with inbound-link rewriting (`obsidian::tools::rename_note`), YAML frontmatter editor with validation before write

### Phase 9 — GUI intelligence & polish ✅ (packaging prepared, distribution deferred)

- [x] Related-notes section in the note panel (TF-cosine, click-to-load); semantic search mode in the Search tab over the persistent Phase 3 vector index; AI actions (summarize / suggest tags / translate / ask-about-document) via `llm::complete`, with results in a rendered overlay offering Copy and Insert-into-note
- [x] Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) covering every app action, including themes and AI (shortcut *customization* not implemented)
- [x] Settings dialog (Cmd/Ctrl+,): theme, content font size, Anthropic API key — persisted locally and re-applied on launch
- [ ] Large-vault performance pass (virtualized tree) and full accessibility audit — buttons are labeled and overlays are keyboard-dismissable, but no formal audit yet
- [x] Packaging prepared: bundle enabled in `tauri.conf.json` with a full icon set (`.icns` included); build a `.app`/installers with `cargo install tauri-cli` + `cargo tauri build` from `gui/`. Signing/notarization deferred — needs Apple Developer certificates

## GUI parity plan (post-roadmap, July 2026)

Full-parity pass against Typora / Obsidian / MacMD Viewer / Marked 2. Each phase ends with a manual `cargo run -p to_markdown_gui` check.

### Phase A — Rendering fidelity ✅
- [x] Local images + `![[image]]` embeds inlined as data URLs; PDF/audio/video embeds
- [x] syntect syntax highlighting (class-based, light/dark scoped CSS)
- [x] Callouts, `==highlight==`, `%%comments%%`; `![[Note]]` transclusion (depth-capped)
- [x] KaTeX math + Mermaid diagrams (vendored under `gui/ui/vendor/`)
- [x] Fixture additions (`Rendering Demo.md`, `attachments/pixel.png`) + 6 render unit tests

### Phase B — Editor & preview UX ✅
- [x] Synced scrolling editor ↔ preview (percentage, loop-guarded)
- [x] Interactive edit preview: checkbox toggling writes to the editor buffer; wikilinks navigate (exiting edit mode)
- [x] Zen mode (hide chrome) + typewriter mode (caret line centered)
- [x] Formatting shortcuts (Cmd+B/I, Cmd+Shift+K/X), Tab/Shift+Tab list indent, Enter auto-continues lists/checkboxes (empty item clears)
- [x] Paste URL over selection → markdown link
- [x] Selection word/char stats in the status bar (both modes)
- [x] Document statistics overlay (Flesch/grade via doc_intel, top words via rag::text_statistics)
- [x] Keyword repetition highlighter toggle (top-8 words marked in the preview)
- [x] Hover page preview on wikilinks (new peek_note command, rendered snippet popover)
- [x] Dark-mode polish: softer base16-eighties syntax theme, theme-aware Mermaid (re-renders on theme switch), calmer highlight color
### Phase C — Vault workflows ✅
- [x] Note tabs (Cmd+click opens in new tab, × / middle-click closes, Cmd+W, Cmd+1..9, persisted per vault)
- [x] Daily note (Cmd+D, palette): opens today's note or creates it per `.obsidian/daily-notes.json` (with template)
- [x] New note from template (palette; lists the vault's templates folder)
- [x] File-tree right-click menu: new note here, new folder, pin/unpin, rename with link rewriting, copy path, reveal in Finder, delete (typed confirmation)
- [x] Inline `#tags` render as clickable anchors jumping to tag search (headings unaffected)
- [x] Note panel: outgoing links (click to resolve+open) and unlinked mentions (plain-text title/alias hits in non-linking notes)
- [x] Pinned notes section at the top of Files (per vault)
- [x] Graph filter box (name match hides non-matching nodes/edges)
- [x] Multi-vault manager in Settings + "reopen last vault on launch" toggle
### Phase D — In-place WYSIWYG block editor (Typora-style) ✅
- [x] Lossless block splitter in Rust (`render::split_blocks`, property-tested: concat == source for every fixture note + edge cases: frontmatter, fences with blanks, unclosed fences, $$ math, no trailing newline)
- [x] Live view: all blocks rendered; click a block to edit its raw Markdown in an auto-sized textarea; Escape/blur commits, the doc re-splits and re-renders, autosaves through save_file
- [x] Links, tags, checkboxes, and hover previews work on inactive blocks like the reading view; "+ Click to write…" appends a block
- [x] Formatting shortcuts, list auto-continue, paste-image/URL shared with the split editor (element-generic handlers); Tab/Shift+Tab jumps table cells inside a row
- [x] Three view modes — Reading / Live / Split — via the toolbar cycle, Cmd+E (read↔live), Cmd+Shift+E (split), and the palette; vault notes open in Live by default (Settings toggle to disable)
- [x] Fixed along the way: multi-line `$$ … $$` display math never rendered (line-based inline pass); now collected across lines
- Deviations: arrow-key navigation into blocks not implemented (click only); autocomplete popup available in Split mode only
### Phase E — App integration (file associations, native menu, window state, DOCX/RTF export, packaging)
